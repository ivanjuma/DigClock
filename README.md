# DigClock
Getting Started
Create a function which will do all of the work to calculate and show the time.

Use the Date Library in Javascript to retrieve the current date and time information. Use the different methods that are provided to you for retrieving the individual hour, minute and second information.

Use the setInterval method to utilize the function you've created to update each second.

Your solution will include one CSS file which contains your page styles, one JS file which contains your clock logic and one HTML file which contains your page structure and loads the CSS and JS resources.
